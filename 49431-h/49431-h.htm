<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The author of this thesis does not lay claim to profound scholarship
or extended research. It may contain errors that are perceptible
to a careful student of Greek archaeology, even without subjecting the
paper to a minute scrutiny. The material has been found scattered
through the writings of ancient and modern authors and in the records
of many excavations and the treasures of many museums. In the
process of gathering from so extended a field, it is but natural that
mistakes should have crept into the work. The effort has been made
to exclude as many errors as possible and to weed out those that could
be discovered with as great diligence as the inexperience of the author
permitted. The labor of compilation has been undergone in the hope
that a connected account of these ancient burial customs might breed
an interest in the subject and prove an incentive to a more extended
examination by some whose curiosity might not be strong enough or
whose leisure time might not be sufficient to gather what was so widely
separated.</p>

DUTY OF BURIAL.</h2>


<p>The task of investigation in this field of Grecian
antiquities is akin to that of a blind man, patching
together the fragments of a shattered vase with no
guidance but the rough outline of innumerable pieces.
Every nook and corner of Greek literature must be
explored, every exhumed inscription, monument, statue
and vase must be carefully scanned, to find a hint here
and there to illustrate and illuminate the subject.
Using the word <em>monument</em> in a broad sense, it is from
monuments, rather than literature, that we get the most
trustworthy information on Greek burial customs.
Ancient literature reveals the thought of the superior
minds. The common people speak through the memorials
that have been left in sculptures, inscriptions,
and vases, of their attachment to life and their despondency
and gloom in view of death.</p>

<p>In nothing, is the refinement of the Greek more
clearly shown than in his reverence for the dead and
in the ceremonies which surrounded the burial. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
spoke of burial as “the customary,” “the fitting,” or
“the right.” Even those persons were remembered
who were stricken by sudden death at the wayside.
The law of Athens required any one who chanced upon
a corpse at least to cover it with earth<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Although
one had entertained the bitterest enmity toward the
deceased while he lived, all remembrance of the feud
must be thrown aside when death intervened and due
attention must be shown the dead. That is the motive
of the magnanimity of Theseus toward the dead Argives
who had been slain at Thebes. They had been dragged
away by the Thebans, whom they had injured, to be
left unburied. The king of Athens was contemplating
their interment, when a herald was sent out from
Thebes, to rebuke him for interfering on behalf of those
whose arrogance had been the sole cause of their misfortunes.
Then it is that the poet<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> makes Theseus
blaze forth with a sentiment to which all Greece responded;
“Not,” says the hero, “in order to injure the
city or bring upon it a bloody strife, do I deem it right
to bury these dead bodies, but rather to preserve the
law of all the Greeks.” Rather than abate, in the least,
his high ideal of duty, the heroic king incurs a war
with Thebes and the impious Thebans suffer well-merited
disaster.</p>

<p>The general opinion of Greece strongly condemned
an animosity so lasting as to extend to neglect of the
dead. Isocrates made a telling point when, appealing
in behalf of the Plataeans to the Athenians against the
Thebans, he exclaimed<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>: “It is not an equal misfortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for the dead to be denied burial and for
the living to be deprived of their country, since the
former is yet more disgraceful to those that forbid the
funeral rites than to those who suffer the inhumanity.”</p>

<p>Under any circumstances, there was a stigma on him
who left any dead body without a proper final resting-place;
but he who neglected to bury a parent, a relative
or near friend, was deemed an outcast and unfit to live
with the rest of the community. Isaeus urges that
misconduct as a reason why Chariades should not receive
the property, intended for him by the will of
Nicostratus. The testator had given everything to
Chariades, but the orator declares him unworthy the
inheritance and incapable of taking under the will,
since he had neither cremated nor even collected the
bones of his deceased benefactor<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. In another case of
a disputed inheritance, the same advocate introduces
witnesses, to show that the proposed heir was disqualified
from receiving the property, on the ground
that, when he discovered where the property of the deceased
was secreted, he ran off immediately to secure
the goods, and neglected the burial<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Disregard of the dead was urged even as a disqualification
for office. A certain Philon, having been chosen
senator by lot, is challenged at the <i>dokimasia</i> as not
worthy the dignity. The strongest objection against
him was that his mother, when she was dying, fearing
that he would not attend to her funeral, left money
and directions for her burial to a perfect stranger.
“If then,” queries the orator, “a mother, who naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is always indulgent toward the faults of her children,
and is guided by her heart alone, feared that the avarice
of her son would control him, what must <em>we</em> think
of such a son<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>?”</p>

<p>According to the law of Solon, a father might by his
bad conduct become unworthy of filial affection and the
son of such a father might be freed from the obligations
due an honorable parent. But, even in so extreme
a case as that, where a son had been relieved of all duties
during the life of the parent, the obligation revived
at death and there remained the same legal duty to
attend to the burial of the father. On that ground,
Aeschines declares that “It is not compulsory for a
youth to support or furnish a home for a father who
has let out prostitutes, but, if the parent die, let the
son bury him, and perform the customary duties<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.”</p>

BURIALS EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>


<p>So stringent was the law concerning the duty of
burial among the ancient Greeks. Yet there were extreme
cases where burial was forbidden. It was the
severest aggravation of the penalty of execution for a
crime that the body of the criminal was denied interment.
Such corpses, both at Athens and Sparta, were
cast with the halter and their garments into a pit
in an allotted quarter of the city, where the flesh might
decay or be eaten by carrion birds. At Athens this
<i>barathrum</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, as it was usually called, was situated in the
quarter called <i>Melita</i>, very near the house of Themistocles,
and the temple which he had erected to Artemis
<i>Aristobule</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Sparta also had a pit or underground
cavern, called Caeadas<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, to which were consigned the
corpses of malefactors. After the Lacedemonians had
kept Pausanias confined till he was starved to death,
they first meditated throwing his remains into this disgraceful
place, but afterwards, changing their minds,
they buried him in the ground somewhere thereabouts<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who destroyed their own lives became felons,
but were not so hardly dealt with as those who had
been executed for crime. Interment was allowed the
suicide, but the hand which committed the deed was
chopped off and buried apart from the body<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. A
modern scholar<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> attributes this treatment to the fear
which the Greeks had that the corpse might become a
vampire; but the sentimental reason of Josephus, that
the felonious hand was considered alien to the body,
appears much more like the ancient manner of thought.
As an additional degradation to the corpses of suicides,
Plato recommends that they be buried without honor
apart from the other dead in an uncultivated and nameless
region, and that their place of interment be unmarked
by any pillar or name<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. From this suggestion
and the fact that burials sometimes did take place
after dark, as when Cassandra prophesied to Agamemnon
that “being a base fellow, basely shall you be
buried at night, and not in the day<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,” Becker has
concluded that “the witching time of night” might
have furnished the occasion for the entombment of
self-destroyers<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. That is certainly reasonable.</p>

<p>From the fate of many traitors, the conclusion is
warranted that those who were guilty of the heinous
crime of treason were refused burial in their native
land. For this reason, the heroes Polynices, Palamedes
and Telamonian Ajax, on the conclusion of their
mythical career, were each prevented from burial at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
home<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Even the bones of Themistocles, according to
some, were interred secretly at Athens, without the
knowledge of the Greeks, “for,” says Thucydides, “it
was against the law to bury him there, as he had been
outlawed for treason<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.”</p>

<p>Lastly, burial was denied, or at least entombment
with others was refused, to those who had been killed
by lightning. This, from the modern point of view,
seems more extraordinary than the other cases of forbidden
sepulture that have been mentioned, but the
ancients considered any one who was killed in that
manner as struck by a god, who knew of some crime
that had been hidden from mortal eye. Theseus, who
was renowned for his piety, in speaking of those slain
at Thebes, declared that he would burn the corpse of
Capaneus apart, because he was struck by the flame
hurled from Zeus’s own hand, but that he would burn
all the others on a single funeral pyre<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Plutarch declares
that the bodies of those who have been killed by
that means never putrefy, and that “many people
never burn nor bury such bodies, but let them lie above
ground with a fence about them, so that every one may
see that they remain uncorrupted<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.” In some cases, on
the other hand, the remains of these wretched beings
were cremated and then interred<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. We must bear in
mind, however, that the prohibition of burial or a
separate entombment in the case of a man struck by
lightning, did not necessarily signify disgrace, but was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in a certain sense, indicative of distinction. His
corpse was considered “sacred” or appropriated to
the gods, and, as such, could not be dealt with in the
conventional way<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>In opposition to the circumstances under which
burial was denied, were the cases and conditions which
called for extraordinary funeral ceremonies. Special
pomp was displayed in honoring those who had suffered
a violent death at the hand of a murderer. As
the funeral procession moved slowly and solemnly
along to the grave, an upright spear was carried in
advance, to typify the manner of the unfortunate one’s
death<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. On arriving at the place of entombment, this
spear was set up in the grave. That was done even
when, for lack of means, no procession had been conducted<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.
After that, proclamation was made at the
tomb, to discover, if possible, whether the deceased
had any relatives who might avenge the murder.
Afterward the grave was watched for three days<a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>A peculiar ceremony was also observed when a
person was drowned, or where, through any other
mischance, it happened that the body could not be recovered.
Under those circumstances, the ancient law
of the Greeks bade them erect a cenotaph<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. The following
bit, a portion of a most pleasing little epigram,
written in memory of a youth lost at sea, and admirably
illustrating this law, we owe to Callimachus:</p>

<div class="pcont">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The surges toss his breathless frame,</div>
<div class="verse">An empty tomb preserves his name<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of Euripides’s plays, by means of this custom
and various other ceremonies, which Helen declares to
be part of the Grecian religion, Theoclymenes is outwitted
and the triumphant husband and wife, once
more reconciled, succeed in returning to their native
land<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<p>If Chariton, who was a very late writer, is to be
trusted, it would seem also to have been the custom,
when the body could not be found, to carry along in
the procession, upon a bier, an image in lieu of the
actual corpse<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Reiske, in his commentary, does not
appear to consider this evidence as conclusive, but
thinks that Chariton is, in this case, confounding
Grecian with Roman ceremonies. The commentator
alludes to the custom at Rome, in the apotheosis of
the emperor, and even in other funerals, of bearing
along an effigy<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>Were Chariton the only authority on the subject, his
statement might be disregarded as of little value, but
Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> mentions this same custom of the effigy as
having been observed on the death of a Spartan king,
who had died abroad. Yet that fact establishes nothing
more than a mere possibility. It is a well-attested fact,
however, that the Athenians were wont to carry one
sumptuous empty bier as representative of those who
had been slain in battle, but whose bodies had not been
recovered<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentiment of honoring those whose mortal remains
eluded search was, in itself, very beautiful, but
woe betide the man who came back after his friends
had supposed him dead and had performed his funeral
rites. His superstitious brethren would not allow him
to take part in their sacrifices, nor even to approach
those solemnities. They avoided his company as carefully
as if he had been a spectre from the nether world<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="III">III.<br />
PREPARATION FOR BURIAL.</h2>


<p>With the exception, possibly, of one or two features,
survivals of their ancient religion, a description of the
burial customs of the representative Greeks during the
historic period, would, to-day, in no way, seem barbarous
nor even extraordinary.</p>

<p>In the Homeric times, the blood of men and animals
was regarded as the nourishment most agreeable to the
dead. Achilles, on the tomb of Patroclus, slew twelve
young Trojans, four horses, two dogs and a herd of
cattle and of sheep<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Ulysses, sacrificing the sheep on
the side of the pit he had dug, called on the shades of
the dead heroes, and the shades, gathering about him
in swarms, drank eagerly this bloody libation<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. Human
sacrifices are referred to as occurring in the prehistoric
period. But these barbarous customs no longer existed
when veritable history commenced. The law of Solon
forbade the sacrifice of an ox in the funeral ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.</p>

<p>In the sixth century, B. C., the law of Ceos still permitted
the sacrifice of victims according to the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rite<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, but, in the fifth century, those sacrifices appear
to have become the privilege of the gods and of the
dead heroes<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p>But, excepting the relics of this traditional ceremony
of occasionally sacrificing at the grave, almost everything
connected with the interment of the dead seems
essentially modern. To be sure, this had not always
been the case. The authors who wrote in the classical
and later periods, afford much evidence of the long
strides that this progressive people had made away
from their old rude customs. Plato<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> relates that, formerly,
it was the fashion for the relatives of the deceased
to send for women whose business it was to
collect the bones of the dead in jars; while still earlier,
as he informs us, the Greeks buried their dead at home.</p>

<p>At Athens, Solon<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> made great improvements. He it
was that forbade men to speak ill of the dead, on the
ground that piety required them to consider the dead
as sacred. Such a doctrine against the perpetuation
of hatred is not many removes from the dispensation of
the nineteenth century. Sparta also had a reformer in
Lycurgus, but his measures, as we should expect of
one who was trying to rear a race of warriors and law-abiding
citizens, looked more to the intellectual and
social advancement than to religious progress. His
aim was to do away with all foolish superstitions and
femininities of sentiment<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. He even allowed the monuments
to be erected near the temples that the youths
might become accustomed to seeing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The best connected account of the ceremonies under
discussion is to be found in Lucian’s “<i>de Luctu</i>.” In
spite of the cynical view and the satirical comment indulged
in by that author, there seems, if we may judge
by other writers, to be nothing exaggerated in his descriptions;
and the customs depicted therein were probably
little changed throughout the whole course of
Greek history.</p>

<p>As soon as death had laid hands upon the victim,
the relatives or friends, after gently closing the eyes of
their loved one, inserted, in the dead man’s mouth,
the <i>obol</i>, a coin valued at about three half pence, or
about three cents of our money, which was to serve as
passage money over the Styx. They were very careful
not to overlook this duty, since it was believed that, if
old Charon could not collect his ferriage, the unlucky
shade would be sent back to life<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>They also examined the coin closely, to see whether
it would pass current among the inhabitants of the
lower world<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>An admirable verification of this custom was, in this
century, excavated in the town of Samos in Cephallenia.
A tile coffin dug up at that place was found to contain
the bones of an initiate of the Bacchic mysteries and
between the back teeth of the skull, the <i>danake</i>, a coin,
somewhat more in value than an <i>obol</i>, was still firmly
lodged. The late excavations in Italy, Greece and Asia
have revealed numerous coins in the tombs<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
painting on a vase, which is described by Pottier, shows
a small coin held between the thumb and fore finger of
the figure which represents the deceased<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p>In the “Frogs” of Aristophanes, Dionysus is told
by Heracles, who has returned from the lower regions,
that he will be obliged to pay two <i>obols</i> as ferriage,
since his servant, Xanthias, is with him<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>It seems to have been believed that the sooner this
money was provided the corpse, the earlier would his
voyage over the Styx take place. In a dialogue of
Lucian, a shade who has been left behind, because
Charon finds his craft already too full, declares that he
will prosecute the boatman, since, by leaving a corpse
who was provided with the <i>obol</i> and now a day old, he
was acting contrary to the laws of his superior, Rhadamanthus<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
With the hope, then, of hastening the
voyage, the fare was inserted as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The next stage of the ceremonies was the preparation
of the deceased for his journey. Fearing that
there was insufficiency of water in the lower world, the
corpse was thoroughly bathed. Then it was anointed
with sweet smelling unguents and crowned with flowers
in their season. Finally the friends dressed it in
magnificent garments that it might not take cold on
the road or appear naked before Cerberus<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>At Rome, the dressing of the corpse was performed
by a hired undertaker called the <i>pollinctor</i>, but, among
the Greeks, this delicate task was looked after by the
nearest female relatives and was considered a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sacred duty<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. The paintings that have been found on
the funeral vases, exhibit a remarkable superiority, in
numbers, of the women at the ceremonies preparatory
to interment. Only a single <i>lecyth</i> has been found on
which a man is depicted as taking part in the preliminary
stages of the preparation. It is to the women
that was given the care of making the toilet of the dead
body, of washing it, perfuming it and wrapping it in
the shroud. This custom is referred to by Homer when
Diomede is lightly wounded by Paris and cries out
that he “knows how to strike an enemy more forcibly,
that a man touched by his spear is a dead man and that
around him the vultures are more numerous than the
women<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.” At the funeral ceremonies of Hector, the
chief part is assigned to the women<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>When the tyrannical Creon forbade the burial of
Polynices, Antigone, his sister, demanded the privilege
of bathing the corpse, and, in spite of the king’s opposition,
she endeavored to bury her brother with her
own hands<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>It appears to have been an established custom to
furnish wreaths for the dead<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. We have already learned
from Lucian that these wreaths were made of flowers,
if the death occurred during the right season, and we
have other good authority for believing that the parsley
plant was often employed as a substitute at a time unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
for flowers<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. As in modern burials, these
wreaths were sent by the relatives and friends of the
deceased<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, and were especially numerous at the
funerals of young people. This latter fact is established
by the complaint of a woman of ill-repute, who
exclaims: “I have a mourner, not a lover; he sends me
wreaths and roses, just as he would for an untimely
death<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.”</p>

<p>A honey cake was also given to the deceased<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.
Whether this cake was intended as a sop to the three-headed
guardian of the lower regions, the dog, Cerberus,
is not certainly known; although a scholiast of
Aristophanes informs us that “the honey-cake was
given to the corpses for Cerberus, as the <i>obol</i> was for
the ferryman, and the crown as for those who had won
a prize in life<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.”</p>

<p>Lucian thinks it was the intention of the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, by
the flowers and their perfume, to overcome the repulsiveness
of death. By too critical an inquiry into the
motive of offering flowers to the dead, there is danger
of losing the sense of the poetic charm of the ceremony.</p>

<p>As to the dress worn by the corpse, there has been
some little discussion in respect to its color, whether it
was white or black. If we are to be guided solely by
the ancient authors, there is very little difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
accepting the former color. A scholiast has concluded,
from an episode in Lucian<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, where some young fellows
try to give Democritus a scare by dressing “in a black
garment in a <em>death-like</em> way,” that the ancient Greeks
dressed their corpses in black robes. The passage
hardly warrants the assumption, and is no valid proof
against the conclusion that the deceased was dressed in
white, since the frolickers may have been trying to impersonate
Death himself, “the black-robed king of the
departed,” who is sometimes depicted in “a garb of
sable hue<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.”</p>

<p>Becker adds a more serious objection. He argues
from a passage in which Plato explains that the laying-out,
the procession and the burial of a deceased priest
are different from those observed for other citizens;
and then mentions, among these differences, that the
whole of his funeral robe must be white<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Pausanias
also remarks<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> that, when Aristodemus dreams that his
murdered daughter came to him and gave him a golden
crown and a white vestment, he believes the vision to
portend his death, since “it is the custom among the
Messenians to bury the most illustrious persons
crowned and wrapped in a white garment.” If we take
those statements as correct readings, the only way to
explain the apparent exception to the general rule, is
to note that the white robe is, in each case, a mere incident
among the peculiarities awarded the mighty who
have died, and the color, of itself, is not necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
extraordinary. But it is almost certain, in the case of
Becker’s citation, that he has taken an old reading,
that has now been replaced by a more satisfactory text.
By the addition of another word, the discrepancy disappears
and the obviously correct rendering is, “and
let every one [of those who attended the funeral] wear
a robe entirely white<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, even if we should disregard the
fact that black seems usually to have been the color of
the mourner’s dress, and the necessary consequence
that the shroud of the deceased could hardly have been
of the same color, we certainly still have other good
authority for supposing the dead person to have been
robed in white.</p>

<p>Archilochus points one of his verses with a beautiful
metaphor by indirectly likening the whiteness of the
ashes to which the corpse has been reduced to the
“pure robe” of death<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>Artemidorus states clearly in his work on the interpretation
of dreams that the appearance to a sick man
of “white garments indicates death, because the dead
are wont to be buried in white; while the black dress
prophesies safety, since not those who have died, but
those who are in mourning use the latter dress<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.”
Finally, in the scene where the Greeks prepare the
body of Patroclus for burial, after drawing on some
underwear of fine linen, over all they cover the hero’s
body with a snowy funeral robe<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. The Cean inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
directs that the dead be wrapped in three white
cloths<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Aeschines arraigns Demosthenes because he
appeared in a white garment when he should have
been in mourning for his only daughter<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>Yet it might be a hasty inference to conclude that
the dress of the mourners was absolutely and unqualifiedly
black. In some of the paintings, on the vases,
which have been discovered, the colors are remarkably
well preserved. On the lecyths, only one woman has
been found wearing a dead black robe<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. It will be
noticed that the expression employed by the ancient
authors, does not apply strictly to the color <em>black</em>, as
we generally understand it. In this connection, a black
robe need not imply anything more than a dark shade of
garment in contrast with the whiteness of the material
in which the dead body is robed. Homer says “black
wine,” “black sea,” and “black blood<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.” The color
black is very rare in the vase paintings, and particularly
in funeral scenes. On one lecyth, the ornamental bands
which lie over and hang down from the funeral bed,
and the covering of the bed, are painted in violet<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, on
another lecyth, the shroud is dark green; the undergarment
of one of the women is dark green, and her
outer garment is brown; on another lecyth, a man is
represented wearing an outer garment of dark lilac, and
a woman has a mantle of brown<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>These white lecyths, by the way, were small vases,
the body of which is generally of a white or gray color.
They varied in height from four inches to twenty inches
and more<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. They were simply filled with perfumes
and placed near the funeral bed, that they might
envelop it in their fragrant emanations<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. They held
the myrrh, of which Plutarch also speaks, in his description
of the funeral rites in honor of those who died
at Plataea, and which filled the urns borne by the young
people in the processions<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Some beautiful specimens
of the white lecyths are to be found in the museums at
Athens, in the Louvre, at Vienna, London, Berlin, at
the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and in some
private collections. On the body of the vase, are painted
scenes connected with the funeral ceremonies. Their
authority is final as to the burial customs which they
portray, and, on many of them, the colors are brilliant,
clear and unaffected by time.</p>

<h2 id="IV">IV.<br />
THE LYING IN STATE.</h2>


<p>After the body had been made ready for burial, it
was laid out in state. This was called the <i>prothesis</i>,
and probably took place on the day after the death, in
order that the corpse might have an early burial. From
the statement of Pollux<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> concerning the order of the
ceremonies, it must be inferred that this was the proper
time. That author states that the <i>prothesis</i> came first,
and was followed successively by the <i>ekphora</i> or procession
and the tertial sacrifices. Those sacrifices came
on the fourth day, that is, the third after the day of
the demise<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, and the procession came on the day following
the <i>prothesis</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. Therefore, it is necessary to
conclude that the prothesis, procession and sacrifices
came respectively on the first, second and third day
after the decease. The basis for that calculation is
found in Antiphon’s oration on the death of the chorus
singer<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. Probably that order of events was established
by the law of Solon, which is reported somewhat imperfectly
in Demosthenes<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. In the case of those Athenians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
however, who had fallen in battle, the lying-in-state
took place three days before the procession<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p>This desire which the Greeks had for an early burial,
was due to the same solicitude that caused them to be
in haste to provide the passage-money for crossing
the Styx.</p>

<p>Socrates is made to say that, when the soul has departed,
men carry away the bodies of their near friends
and bury them as soon as they can<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. The spirit of
Patroclus, weary of the long delay, while the struggle
continued over his mortal remains, and angered by the
criminal apathy of his friend, beseeches Achilles to
bury him as speedily as possible, that he may the
sooner pass the gates of Hades<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>Most truly it has been said that in the eyes of the
Greeks, “a quick burial is a propitiation of the
deceased<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.”</p>

<p>Since the lying-in-state took place a day and a half in
advance of burial, and since it was necessary that this
ceremony should be performed on the next day after
the person had died, it was set down as a great stigma
on a man’s character that preparations for the <i>prothesis</i>
of his relative were not made in due time<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>A law of Ceos, enacted probably in the latter part of
the sixth century, and resembling the law of Solon
very closely, regulates the matter of burials with considerable
particularity. This law aims to restrain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
excessive cost of funeral ceremonies. It limits the
wrappings of the dead to three white cloths, of which
the total price shall not exceed one hundred drachmas,
about twenty dollars of our money; the body must be
laid on a bed with slender legs, and must not be entirely
concealed by the draping, a precaution against
violent deaths<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. In the paintings, the face and the
upper part of the breast are uncovered. The color of
the wrappings or shroud on the lecyths are not
uniformly white, for some of violet and some even of
green, are seen on these white vases, which belong to
the fourth and fifth centuries before our era, and which
are found almost exclusively in the tombs of the Athenians<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the women who took
part in the funeral rites were required to be near relatives
of the deceased. This legal requirement is illustrated
by a painted <i>terra-cotta</i> plaque, published by
Benndorf, on which are inscriptions near the figures.
By these inscriptions, it appears that the persons about
the bed of the deceased are the grandmother, the
mother, and the sisters, the father and the brothers<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p>The relatives who, in the pictures, stand about the
funeral bed or bier, display gestures of some violence,
indicating that time has not yet softened the keenness
of their sorrow. They hold various objects in their
hands, which are intended as offerings at the tomb. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
sort of narrow scarf is very frequent<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. It is composed
of a flat band of cloth, terminating in a fringe at each
end, and the color is by no means uniform; red, black
and violet appearing in different instances. This long,
narrow scarf was employed in all religious ceremonies,
sacrifices, thanksgivings and consecrations. Its significance
is difficult to determine. The purpose of the fan,
however, in the hands of a mourner of the period of the
white lecyths, was undoubtedly to guard the body from
the attacks of flies during its exposure<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>Another singular object which is present at various
scenes of mourning and burial is a bird. Its use is
a matter of surmise, and the fact that the bird is of no
one species, but sometimes a dove and, at times, a duck
or some other bird, makes the interpretation of its
presence none the less puzzling. The most satisfactory
suggestion is, that it is simply intended as a pleasant
reminder to the deceased of an object familiar to him
in the life just closed<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. As companions and sources of
amusement and pleasure, the dog and the bird played
a prominent part in the in-door life of the Greeks. On
that account, probably, the young man with his dog
and the young girl with her bird are very often seen in
funeral bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>A scholiast remarks on this custom of <i>prothesis</i>, or
lying-in-state, that “the ancients laid their corpses
before the doors and beat their breasts<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.” Becker finds
considerable difficulty in reconciling this with Solon’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
law ordering “the dead man to be laid out within the
house according as he left orders.” If we were to interpret
the expression, “before the doors,” as indicating
that the ceremony took place outside the house, it
would indeed be difficult to harmonize the two authorities;
but modern scholars generally have seen that it
is not a strained construction to interpret the phrase as
meaning the vestibule or fore part of the house<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>In the entrance-hall of the house, then, the body
was laid out with the feet turned toward the door, to
indicate, perhaps, that he was about to go forth on his
last journey, never again to return to the habitations
of the living<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. From the fact that the head was placed
on a rest<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of some sort, it has been inferred<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> that the
corpse was laid out on a <i>kline</i> or bed. There is no passage
in any author to substantiate this, but the paintings
on the white lecyths present the fact very clearly<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.
There is also an account of a <i>prothesis</i> in which they
strew sweet marjoram and broken vine branches underneath
the body<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.</p>

<p>Near the body<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, were placed the <i>lecyths</i> or cruses
which have been already in part described. These
were afterwards to be burned or buried with the corpse.
According to a scholiast, these lecyths were used by
the Athenians as vessels for holding the unguents with
which the dead were to be anointed, but their use for
containing perfumes is now conceded<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. There was a
class of men at Athens whose occupation consisted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the manufacture and decoration of white lecyths<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.
These vases were not baked as hard as most other
earthen vessels but were fashioned with great delicacy
of manipulation. They were soft and fragile and rested
on a circular broad base, they narrowed abruptly as
they rose, then expanded suddenly into a cylindrical
body of about the same diameter as the base, then contracted
into a short neck on which was supported a
cup-shaped mouth piece from the side of which started
the small round handle that was attached at its lower
end to the body of the vase. The upper and lower
part were covered with a black coating or enamel<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.</p>

<p>The centre or body was painted white and, on that
background, were drawn and painted the funeral scenes
with considerable artistic skill and more or less accuracy
of drawing and detail according to the grade of
article that the artificer desired to make. The ultimate
design of the workman was not to produce a work of
art but an article of commerce, although, incidentally,
figure-painting of a high order of merit was often attained<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
They were not manufactured later than the
second century before the Christian era<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>, and represent
the customs of the Athenians for a period extending
through the fifth and fourth centuries.</p>

<p>When the <i>lecyths</i> were once buried with the corpse,
it was considered a very serious offence to disturb them.
On a lecyth that was unearthed in a grave at Cumae,
there is a curse of blindness invoked on any one who
might venture to steal it<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. The custom of leaving objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of value at the tombs made them liable to depredations
and many funeral inscriptions conveyed threats
of punishment against those who should take or disturb
whatever was thus offered to the dead<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p>Just outside the door of the house within which the
body was laid out, stood an earthen vessel of lustral
water, so that the visitors who went to look on the features
of their friend for the last time, could purify
themselves from any pollution which they might have
incurred by entering a home defiled by death. Since
everything appertaining to the stricken house was held
to be contaminated, the purifying water had to be obtained
from another house<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. This vessel which contained
the water was variously styled an <i>ostrakon</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, an
<i>ardanion</i><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> or a <i>pegaion</i><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>This exposure of the body to the view of the friends
was not merely for display but served often as a police
regulation, and, at the same time, it prevented the
lamentable mistake of burial where unconsciousness
had simulated death. To some extent, it took the place
of our coroner’s inquest, for we learn from Pollux<a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that
“the laying out was for this reason, too, that the corpse
might be seen not to have suffered violence.” The
utility of this measure was promoted by the law which
ordered the prothesis not to be for a longer or shorter
time than to show whether the person was in a trance
or really dead<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="V">V.<br />
OUTWARD GRIEF.</h2>


<p>The outward manifestations of grief were very
marked. At this point, it is necessary to notice only
the lamentation and exaggerated grief which took place
at the laying-out and in the procession. A consideration
of the signs of mourning exhibited in the dress,
should properly be made after a discussion of the other
features of the burial.</p>

<p>This lamentation was rendered, to a large extent, by
the women<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. It must be regarded rather as a necessary
form than as a genuine expression of woe. There were,
of course, cases where real sorrow and affection called
forth the tears and lamentations of thousands. Such a
tribute to Timoleon’s character was paid by his
countrymen, the Syracusans<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. In the great majority of
cases, however, this excessive grief was but a species
of empty pageantry. Plato would have had wailing
altogether forbidden, as being too common place, at
the death of a priest<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. In the earlier days, this fashionable
excess grew to such an alarming extent that Solon
was obliged to interfere by a law, to cut down these
demonstrations. He forbade the survivors to tear themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and ordered them to dispense with the hired
mourners, whose lamentable notes were intended to
excite sorrow<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. He also commanded that no woman
under sixty who was not at least a second cousin to
the deceased should enter the house before the interment<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>Charondas, the celebrated law-giver of Catana and
Magna Graecia, made a law, which so far surpassed
Solon’s in rigor as to forbid all lamentation. He thought
it better that respect for the dead should be shown
by decking their graves and otherwise keeping their
memory green<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. It is very unlikely, however that
these laws had any permanent effect on the habits of
the people. For a time, they may have checked excesses,
but there certainly are many late proofs that
this custom of violent and loud lamentation was long
continued. We find all through the tragedies that the
women still tear their hair<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>, whenever any of their
relations have left this life, and, wound their breasts<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,
rip open their cheeks<a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>, and cry with sorrowful voices<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.
It is possible that the poets intended, in these passages,
merely to portray the former customs, or, it
might be, that the action is exaggerated to heighten
the stage-effect; but, since there are many other proofs
that these old barbarities remained in vogue outside
the mimic life of the stage, it is unnecessary to speculate
on the purpose of the dramatists. Lucian declares
that the beating of the breasts, lacerating of the cheeks,
pouring of ashes on the head and knocking the head
upon the ground always occurred, so that the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
were more to be pitied than the dead<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Again, we have
in Plutarch’s consolatory letter to his wife, on the loss
of their little girl, a severe invective against this practice
in his time. His philosophy is worthy of the
Christian era. “But since,” says he, “our little daughter
afforded all our senses the sweetest and most charming
pleasure, so we ought to cherish her memory, which
will conduce in many ways, or rather manifold, more to
our joy than to our grief.” Then, after praising his
wife for not disfiguring herself or her maids, or indulging
in any other dramatic expression of grief, he goes
on to say: “For a virtuous woman ought not only to
preserve her purity in riotous feasts but also to reason
thus with herself that, in violent grief, the tempest of
the mind, must be calmed by patience, and this does
not intrench on the natural love of parents toward their
children, as many think, but only struggles against
the disorderly and irregular passions of the mind<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.”</p>

<p>Morever, many of the works of art which have descended
to us also prove that this excess of lamentation was
not altogether abolished by the law of Solon. On the
lecyths which represent the <i>prothesis</i>, it will be observed
that the women have their hands on their heads as if
tearing their hair<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> although this gesture may be only a
conventional sign of mourning<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> adopted to indicate grief
in the funeral monuments and vases just as an interior
may be symbolized by a door or a pillar that supports
the roof, a temple by an altar and the fact that the
scene was out of doors was indicated by foliage in some
form or by the branch of a tree<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI.<br />
THE PROCESSION.</h2>


<p>By the third day<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, it was thought that time enough
had elapsed to show whether life was really extinct<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. A
procession was then formed to accompany the body to
the tomb. After a time, this delay of three days may
have been less rigidly observed for the interment was
permitted on the day immediately following the decease.
Callimachus sings of a youth “whose friends saw him
alive one day, and the next day they wept at his grave<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.”
Again, Pherecydes, the philosopher, eaten up by disease,
invites his physicians to attend his funeral on the
morrow<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. But, when a distinguished and worthy man,
such as Timoleon, died, and it was necessary to make
extensive preparations for the funeral, and to send
notice to the neighboring inhabitants and strangers,
the time intervening between the death and the burial
was probably extended<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>The hour set for the <i>ekphora</i>, or funeral procession,
was in the early morning, before sunrise<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. Bos<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> cites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the cases of Patroclus<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and Achilles<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> as proof that it
was only those who died in the flower of youth that
were buried before sunrise. Yet there are other passages<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
sufficient to convince us that the time for all
funerals was usually the hour before dawn.</p>

<p>We know that the body was carried to the grave on
a <i>kline</i> or bier<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, presumably that on which the <i>prothesis</i>
had been accomplished, but who conveyed it thither is
in doubt. It would naturally be expected that it was
borne by relatives or friends of the deceased, yet no
authority has been found to support the surmise.
There is, on the contrary, a passage in Pollux<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> which
might be construed to indicate that there was a class of
men who were called, professionally, “corpse-bearers”
or “buriers,” and whose sole business was pall-bearing.
Pollux is rather late authority, but, on turning back to
the tragedies, Electra appears, telling her brother to
let the crows and dogs act as “buriers” of Ægisthus<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.
Furthermore, it is a number of trained slaves that carry
Alcestis to the tomb<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>When a man of prominence died, he was borne to the
grave by youths chosen by the people<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. There is a reported
instance of the burial of a priest, where one
hundred youths<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, trained in the gymnasium, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
selected by the relatives of the deceased. It was the
custom for members of a fraternity to act as pall-bearers
for one of their fellows. Demonax<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, when he died,
was borne along by his brother philosophers. That
custom survives to our time in the funeral processions
of the <em>free-masons and odd-fellows</em>.</p>

<p>In the van of the procession, just before the corpse<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>,
or immediately behind, came the hired dirge-singers,
pouring forth their doleful lays<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. Plato, perhaps
through carelessness, speaks of these hired singers in
the masculine gender<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>; but Hesychius is undoubtedly
correct in stating that women<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> habitually took that
part. They were first brought over from Caria<a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, and
hence the significance of the allusion to a dirge as a
“Carian melody<a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.”</p>

<p>The late authors, Pollux<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and Sextius Empiricus<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>,
confounded the dirge-singers with the Roman <i>praeficae</i>
and thought that they were flute-players. The flutes
of ivory which have been discovered in some of the
Grecian graves, would seem to support that view<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.
Schreiber has a picture of a funeral procession, in which
a flute-player is seen behind the rude wagon that bears
the body of the deceased<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Any <em>man</em> might join in the dismal march to the
grave, but every <em>woman</em> was debarred the melancholy
privilege, unless she had passed her sixtieth year<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, or
was connected with the deceased by blood and was
over sixteen years of age. There are two instances
mentioned in literature when this law was violated.
Lysias<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> refers to a daughter who followed her stepmother
to the grave; while Terence, whose plays are
adaptations and almost translations of the Greek comedies,
makes poor Glycerium attend the funeral of her
adopted sister, the beautiful Andrian<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Even in those
cases, the exception is rather apparent than real; for,
in each instance, affection has transmuted a nominal
into an actual kinship.</p>

<p>There are some intimations of military funerals on the
monuments, amphoras and vases that have been found
in Grecian soil, as well as references to such pageants
in the Greek authors. On a stamped plaque of <i>terra
cotta</i>, in the collection of M. Rayet<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, appears a procession
with two young men in military dress, possibly
sons of the deceased, who march behind the women
that surround the funeral car. The black figures on an
amphora<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, represent the cortege as composed of women
and some armed men mounted on chariots. A beautiful
amphora from Cape Colias<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, is painted with some
red figures. There, beside the scene of <i>prothesis</i>, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
some knights preparing to follow the funeral convoy.
They have lowered the points of their lances, in sign
of mourning. It is not improbable that these soldiers
escort a companion-in-arms to his last resting place. A
passage from Plato<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, prescribing the order of the cortege
for the interment of the first citizens of the state,
directs that there shall march, at the head of the procession,
young unmarried men, clothed in military costume,
then that the boys go before the bier and sing
the national hymn, with the girls following behind, and
such of the women as happen to be beyond the age of
child-bearing. Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> writes, that armed soldiers
escorted the urn which contained the ashes of Philopoemen.</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII.<br />
BURNING OR INHUMATION?</h2>


<p>Did the Greeks burn their dead like many nations of
the ancient world, or did they bury them immediately
like the majority of people since the Christian era?
The question has been vigorously debated. Lucian, in
a general way, declares that the fashion of the Greeks
as contrasted with the various customs practiced respectively
among the Persians, the Indians, the Scythians,
and the Egyptians, was to cremate their dead<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.
Some have accepted this statement in a literal sense;
on the other hand, a German scholar<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> of no little repute
insists that “in the historic period, interment was
universal.” The truth, as usual, lies between these
extremes. Burial and cremation existed together at
every period.</p>

<p>The ancient authors mention many cases outside of
the Homeric period where the dead were burned. Let
us take up the instances in chronological order and see
whether they will not cover every era. Plutarch preserves
a couplet of Archilochus, in which the writer
bewails the drowning of his brother-in-law and declares
that he would not so mourn, if his bones had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
properly cremated<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. Again, although Plutarch has
properly stamped as incredible and legendary the story
that the ashes of Solon were strewed about Salamis,
still the fact that the tale received any credence shows
that such a disposition of his remains was possible and
probable<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Two centuries later, Isaeus gives as proof
of the utter invalidity of Chariades’s claim to the property
of Nicostratus, the fact that he had not cremated
the body of the deceased nor even collected his bones<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
The case of Timoleon is historical. His remains were
not immediately laid away but were first incinerated<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.
When Philopoemen died, almost fifty years afterward,
a similar fate befell his body<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. Probably, following
such precedents, Lycon, the philosopher, whose period
of activity is unknown, left directions in his will, that
his heir of the same name, together with two others,
should attend to the expenses of his cremation and to
the other customary solemnities<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. It is safe, then, to
conclude that the funeral pyre was used through all
periods of Grecian history.</p>

<p>If, in a similar manner, a review is made of the cases
of inhumation that are recorded, it will be found, in
spite of those who accept Lucian so literally<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>, and notwithstanding
others who believe that inhumation was
employed only in the mythical period<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, that the custom
of immediate burial existed during every century and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
was always contemporaneous with cremation. In the
first place, the graves that have been opened in modern
times reveal the fact that burial without burning existed
at a very early period<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p>The Athenians being ordered by an oracle to take up
the bones of Theseus and lay them in an honorable
place at Athens, were directed to the supposed grave
by an eagle and there they found the coffin of a man
of extraordinary size, with a sword and lance lying
by it<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>Again the pretty myth of Alcestis would be completely
spoiled, if we venture to assume that her
body was burned. Even Lucian seems to admit exceptions
to his rule that the Greeks always burned, when
he speaks of an old man as “having one foot in the
grave, if not the other<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.” That the Athenians of Solon’s
time did sometimes, at least, employ burial is shown by
the clever argument put forward by Solon, and the
brilliant reply by Hereas in the dispute between Athens
and Megara for the possession of Salamis. Solon contended
that the island belonged rather to the Athenians
on the ground that “the manner of burying in Salamis
is in accordance with the custom of Athens and not
that of Megara, for the Megarians inter the dead with
their faces to the east, and the Athenians turn theirs
to the west.” Hereas of Megara begs leave to differ,
asserting that the Megarians likewise turn the faces of
the dead toward the west; and, what is more, like the
people of Salamis, they put three or four corpses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the same tomb, whereas the Athenians have a separate
tomb for each<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. Further reading shows that there
was a law among the Athenians which compelled any
man coming upon an unburied corpse, to bury it so
that it may look toward the west<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p>At Sparta, inhumation was probably the prevailing
custom, since we know that Lycurgus ordered the
corpses to be buried in the city, that the people might
become habituated to the sight of death<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>We also know, to take a specific case, that the Spartan
general Pausanias was buried in the area before
the temple of Artemis<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. To the same purport, is the
description given by a Greek traveler of the simple
custom among the Sicyonians of burying without inscribing
the name of the deceased person’s father and
we may assume that burial without cremation was resorted
to in other states than Athens and Sparta<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.</p>

<p>This examination leads to the conclusion that burial
and cremation existed throughout the entire history of
Greece side by side. A certain old miser, choosing
between the two methods, prefers to be simply buried,
in order that his money, which he has hidden in his
grave-garment, may go with him to the next world<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.
Plato makes Socrates in one of his dialogues speak as
if he were quite uncertain whether his body would be
burned or immediately interred<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. Finally, apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the evidence of manuscripts, we have an undeniable
verification in the fact that tombs have been excavated
both in Magna Graecia and in Greece itself in which
the skeletons are flanked on either side by funeral
urns, thus exhibiting both customs as taking place in
the same family<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Probably burial and cremation stood with the Greeks
somewhat in the relation which they seem about to
attain with us. Although both methods may exist,
the one may hold the supremacy and be, by far, the
more frequently employed. Neither custom was ever
entirely abandoned by the Hellenes, until the influence
of the early Christian church was felt favoring interment
after the Jewish practice. At present, there is a
shrinking from cremation on the part of the great body
of the civilized world, but who can tell what may be
brought about when we have had such advocates
of burning as Sir Thomas Browne, Dr.
Lord, and Sir Henry Thompson? Our great countryman,
Hawthorne, too, has given evidence of a
predisposition, on his part, toward incineration
although there is a touch of humor in his final
suggestion. In his “English sketches,” he, characteristically,
says “Among the classic marbles, I peeped
into an urn that once contained the ashes of dead
people, and the bottom still had an ashy hue. I like
this mode of disposing of dead bodies, but it would be
still better to burn them and scatter the ashes, instead
of hoarding them up&mdash;to scatter them over wheat-fields
or flower-beds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the accounts which we have of the details of
cremation are found in Homer. That great bard gives
some idea of the minor customs which found place
about the funeral pyre. From the account given to
Achilles by Agamemnon, as being a later arrival in the
land of shades, the Greeks were wont, it would seem,
to sacrifice “fat sheep and crooked-horned oxen”
about the pyre and cover the deceased with unguents
and honey<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. Costly garments were also burned together
with the corpse. In a play of Euripides, Hector tries
to console the Muse-mother of Rhesus, by promising
to burn with that departed warrior, “the splendor of
ten thousand robes<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.”</p>

<p>This custom of burning with the deceased the garments
most esteemed in life is mentioned by Lucian as
one of the weaknesses that “mortal flesh is heir to<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.”
With a great soldier, such as Eetion or Elpenor, the
armor was also burned<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>. If the deceased were a distinguished
general, like Patroclus or Achilles, all
present marched thrice around the blazing body<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>As long as the pile continued to throw out fitful
gleams and to consume the corpse, even if it lasted all
night, the friends of the deceased never ceased pouring
out libations<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and calling upon his <i>manes</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. Just before
the flames had entirely vanished, wine was poured
on to extinguish the pyre, and whatever bones were left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
unconsumed were collected with the rest of the ashes
into a vessel and buried. In the burials both of Patroclus
and of Hector, this vessel is made of pure gold
and the remains of the Greek are covered with a double
layer of fat, while soft purple robes perform the same
office for the Trojan<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p>There has been some little doubt expressed as to
whether the body was entombed at the place where
it was burned. In Terence’s Andria, where the Greek
burial is depicted, both ceremonies are conducted in one
spot<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. On the other hand, in the Electra of Sophocles,
Orestes, to deceive his perfidious mother, has an urn
brought to her that is said to contain his ashes after
he had been incinerated in Phocis<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. Again, as a matter
of history, we know that after Philopoemen had been
cremated, his remains were carried back to the city in
a triumphal procession<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. So, on the whole, it is quite
likely that the Roman poet mixed the habits of the
Romans with the customs of the Greeks. Perhaps he
was inaccurately informed on the subject. The entombment
probably took place in quite a different
section from that in which the body was burned.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII.<br />
THE COFFINS.</h2>


<p>Numerous excavations and the close scrutiny which
modern scholars have given to Grecian graves have
made it possible to state with considerable accuracy
the materials employed for coffins, and the various
styles of coffins, tombs and monuments used in ancient
Hellas.</p>

<p>The earlier coffins were usually made of baked clay<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>,
but the authors inform us that, in the case of those
Athenians who fell in battle, and whose bodies were
not found, chests of cypress-wood were buried as cenotaphs<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.
Stone coffins, also, were probably used among
the Greeks. There are preserved traces of a letter to
Plato, from two of his friends, in which they speak of
this burying stone, as found at Assos, in Lydia<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. The
elder Pliny mentions this stone of Assos, called the
<i>sarcophagus</i>, or flesh-eating. He assigns, as the reason
for its name, the fact that “within forty days, it is
known certainly to consume the bodies which are
placed in it, skin, flesh, bones, and all else save the
teeth<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The coffins of baked clay were rudely fashioned, as
might be expected from such coarse material. One of
the oldest kind of coffins was that in which Dionysus,
according to the fable, laid away whatever was mortal
of the beautiful Ariadne. That rude contrivance was
composed of three flat plates of clay, forming a kind of
triangular prism<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, so that this casket of the wine god’s
wife must have been as picturesque and shapely as a
piece of sewer-pipe. Sometimes, however, these pottery
coffins were very highly decorated. They were
painted in brilliant colors<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, with representations of lily-leaves
and palms, the flowering acanthus and the lotus,
and with wreaths and arabesques and intricate tracery.</p>

<p>At a later period, the sides of the triangle assumed
a curved shape. A section of the coffin was a spherical
triangle, and the coffin became more complicated and
durable. Stackelberg gives a very careful description
of the construction of this style, together with an illustration<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.
On the under layer of curved tiling, rest the
bones of the deceased, at the sides are double layers
of tiling, with one at the top. Two upright tiles close
the ends. Another specimen of great interest is the
coffin of a child, unearthed at Athens by Stackelberg,
in the beginning of the present century. It has an
elliptical form, and looks like a movable bath-tub.
Many utensils were found in this coffin, packed away
with the skeleton. They will be described hereafter<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="IX">IX.<br />
THE TOMBS.</h2>


<p>Of the tombs themselves, the recent excavations have
also made us acquainted with the construction and the
varieties. Cumanudis<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, a Greek archæologist, now living
at Athens, enumerates eight distinct types of tombs.
His classification is rather too minute in some respects.
For all practical purposes, there were four kinds of
tombs, differing from each other in general form. They
were variously known as (a) the <i>stelae</i> or shafts, (b) the
<i>kiones</i> or columns, (c) the <i>trapezae</i> or square-cut tombs,
and (d) the <i>naidia</i> [heroia] or temple-like structures.
There were also tombs which were merely heaps of
earth. These mounds were not, however, unimportant;
for it was possible to display there a lavish expenditure.
The tomb of Alyattes, the father of Crœsus, according
to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, was six stadia in circumference,
that is, about two-thirds of a mile. It was made entirely
of earth, except a base formed of great stones,
and was declared by Herodotus to be a monument of
art, second to none but those of the Egyptians and the
Babylonians. This mass was raised by merchants,
laborers and young women who obtained their money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in a questionable manner. On many of the white
lecyths, the mound can be seen to exceed the height of
the persons depicted<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. In a dialogue of Lucian<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>, Hermes
and Charon, from the top of Parnassus and Oeta, piled
one on the other, contemplate the world and that which
attracts their attention in the cemeteries of the large
cities are the heaps of earth, the pillars and the funeral
pyramids.</p>

<p>The <i>stelae</i> proper were slabs of stone, standing upright
in the ground. They were often made of marble<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.
The shape was frequently that of a little chapel, and they
were usually of one piece, the upper part being designated
the <i>epithema</i><a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. This epithema was sometimes
rounded like a coping tile, and sometimes fashioned
like a gable. The latter form of the triangular arch
was suggestive of a religious purpose and the attributing
of divine honors to the dead, for this pediment
belonged to the house of a deity. It was usually adorned
with acanthus leaves, worked into arabesques, closely
resembling those on the coffins<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. The stele of a warrior,
found in the Attic deme of Icaria during the excavations
by the American School in February, 1888, has
been an object of considerable interest to archæologists<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.
The slab of stone had been broken into three
parts, but when compared with the well-known stele
of Aristion, (found in 1838) the Icarian relief was found
to correspond very closely with the older monument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The Icarian stele, when complete, must have been
about eight feet high, and about a foot and a half wide
at the base, tapering slightly as it rose. The figure is
of a warrior in armor, holding an upright spear. There
is unmistakable evidence that the details of the relief
had been painted. The Lyseas stele (found in 1839)
had a uniform surface, on which had been painted
Lyseas, draped in a long himation, and engaged in
pouring out a libation.</p>

<p>The <i>stelae</i> and the tombs were frequently adorned
with reliefs in which the details were probably finished
by painting. The chapel-like form was convenient for
the artist in carving the relief, since this afforded a
retreating background, and gave the figures the appearance
of being within the chapel or temple.</p>

<p>A favorite subject was an idealistic representation of
the dying scene<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. The occupation of the deceased is
also indicated, and a mounted horseman is cut in relief
on the tomb of a knight who fell at Leuctra<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>; on the
tomb of an athlete is seen his figure, with his strigil and
dog<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>; one who had taken prizes for declamation,
music, ball-throwing and ring-tossing is represented
with a scroll, a lyre, the ball and the ring<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. Many similar
carvings and paintings have been recently discovered.
Pausanias refers to this custom of decorating
the tombs, and mentions the picture at Sicyon, on the
monument of Xenodice, who died in child-birth, as particularly
worthy of examination<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Many tomb-stones were evidently intended for general
application, since the inscription sometimes fails
to correspond in every respect with the relief, but
other scenes were wrought out for the particular occasions
on which they were erected. To this latter class
must have belonged the monument at Athens<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>, where
the figures are of heroic size, representing a youth in
the full vigor of early manhood, accompanied by an
old man, leaning on a cane. In the hand of the young
man is a stout club, an attendant is sleeping at his feet,
while his dog is watchfully alert. There is no inscription
to inform us who is commemorated by this monument,
nor what artist has left this wonderful evidence
of his genius and skill, but the subject is treated with
marvellous vigor and grace.</p>

<p>The siren was a familiar figure on the tombstone
either singly or in couples, signifying that, by their
song, the dead were constantly lamented and the living
consoled. A small tombstone in the Berlin Museum
contains a lady engaged in her toilet with the assistance
of an attendant maid and, above them, two sirens are
engaged in playing, the one on the lyre and the other
on the flute.</p>

<p>Very frequently the scene represented typifies the
separation of the deceased from the relatives who stand
sorrowfully about. To the Greek, there was a solemn
dignity in death and that sentiment finds expression in
these reliefs by the representation of the deceased as
seated and rather larger than the other persons of the
group. The nearest relative bids farewell to the seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
figure by clasping hands. In the particulars that have
been mentioned, the scene, in every instance, is nearly
the same but, in other details great variety is introduced.
Now, it is a husband who holds the hand of
his departing wife while her sister stands by her side
and the long sleeved servant is behind the chair resting
her hand upon the back of it, as if ready to render instant
service. Again a mother is going away from her
little daughter and, at the moment of departure, has
placed her arm tenderly about the child and bends
sadly over her. The servant stands as usual behind
the deceased. In another scene, the infant in the arms
of one of the group would suggest that distressing
incident in family history, the death of the young mother
in, or near child-birth. In this group too, there remains
the hand and long sleeve of the servant. In all these
pictures, if it is a lady who is commemorated, she is represented
as holding her veil in a peculiarly graceful
manner, which occurs so frequently as to suggest a
symbol of departure.</p>

<p>Some of the monuments present scenes of every day
domestic life or of a lady engaged about her toilet. In
a relief, found at Athens, some kind of a repast or feast
is shown. A bearded man reclines upon a couch and
holds a plate or saucer in his hand, his wife is seated
at his feet and a naked cup-bearer is near at hand. A
friend stands at the head of the couch and the dog lies
under it.</p>

<p>The lecyth was not an uncommon form of the funeral
monument. The sculptor, in that case, made the vase
of colossal size and decorated it with scenes of curious
interest. On one of them Hermes Psychopompe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
leading away a beautiful figure to the land of shades.
The form of some of the monuments and the inscriptions
on them indicate that they had a double purpose
to serve and that, in addition to being memorials of the
dead, they were votive offerings to the departed, who
had become objects of worship.</p>

<p>In this connection, it may be instructive to refer to
the vigorous contest which has been waged between
different archaeologists over the interpretation of the
representations of feasts on the sepulchral monuments,
reliefs and pictures. The most probable explanation
seems to be that the central figures are not deities<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> but
the deceased receiving that nourishment which he required,
as well after death as while living, that the
patera or the wine cup is extended to receive the libation
or the food, that the horse and dog were the images
of those faithful domestic animals whose usefulness
would be as great in the Elysian fields as during life.
The pomegranate in the hand of the feaster confirms
the opinion that he is a deceased mortal, that fruit
being appropriate to the dead after the analogy of
Persephone who was subtly induced by the god of the
lower world to taste the pomegranate and thereafter
could never return entirely to the upper light. The
presence of the serpent is more difficult to explain, although
the incident of the large snake that twined
about the body of Cleomenes in Egypt and drove away
the birds of prey may assist in clearing up the mystery.
Plutarch says that some of the Alexandrians being
terrified at the sight of the serpent clinging to the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of Cleomenes, it was pointed out that as bulls develop
bees after death, and horses produce wasps, so the
human body, as it decayed, turned into snakes. The
wife of the deceased is seated because the reclining
posture at the table was peculiar to the men and was
never assumed by a modest woman.</p>

<p>The second species of tomb, the <i>Kion</i> or column was
very shapely, having a double base and an Ionic fluting
at the top. In the representations on some of the
lecyths, are the figures of the friends of the deceased
who have come to the <i>Kion</i> to offer services in various
ways. The objects that are seen in their hands are
varied, being mostly offerings for the dead, although
some are articles necessary for the performance of the
funeral rites, while others are articles of the toilet.</p>

<p>The third division of the tombs is the so-called <i>trapezae</i>.
It was a tomb of this species that was used to
mark the resting-place of the orator Isocrates and his
immediate<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> relatives. It was probably this style of
tomb that Cicero called the <i>mensa</i>, the expense of which
Demetrius Phalereus limited<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>heroum</i> or fourth division of the tombs, possessed
many of the features of the Greek temple, with which
every student of art or literature is familiar. The imposing
façade was always present, even when other
parts were wanting, in consequence of the situation’s
forbidding elaborate development of the rest of the exterior.
The structure which the moderns have united
in designating as a “chapel” bears the closest resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to the <i>heroum</i>. Indeed, the <i>heroum</i> differed
from many small temples only in that its opening faced
toward the west, while the entrance to the temple
looked in the opposite direction<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference in this latter respect,
between the Egyptian and the Grecian Tombs. In the
great necropolis of the ancient Egyptians at Memphis
and Thebes, the door, the external inscriptions and
the entablatures of the tombs, almost without
exception look toward the east; while, at Abydos
the tombs often face the south; but, in neither
place do they open to the west<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. So general is
this disposition of the opening that Champollion
and other writers on the subject have made the
fact the basis of an elaborate “assimilation” between
the life of man and the career of the sun, declaring that
the dead yearns toward the rays that shall illumine
his night and draw him from his long sleep<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. Accordingly
he is placed so that he shall catch the first beams
of the morning, or at noon behold the full vigor of the
god of day.</p>

<p>The <i>heroa</i> must have been very numerous in Greece.
That fact is indicated by a chapter from the history of
the Peloponnesian war<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>. From the earliest times, the
Athenians had been accustomed to live in the country
and, before the time of Theseus, Attica was occupied by
independent towns, each of which had its own king.
So that in the Peloponnesian war, when Archidamus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the Spartan king, approached Athens, about the year
430, B. C., Pericles advised the Athenians who lived
outside the walls to bring their families and their effects
into the city. They followed the advice of Pericles
but the city was crowded and, since they were without
shelter they were obliged, with very few exceptions,
to take up their abode in the temples and the
<i>heroa</i>.</p>

<p>The Greeks were very proud of these elaborate
monuments, which were reminders to the
world of the virtues of their ancestors and relations,
and these sepulchres passed down from generation
to generation as an inheritance which the
heir expected to transmit when he had been received
therein<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.</p>

<p>These <i>heroa</i> as a rule, however, were erected in
memory of some great man at that period when death
had brought about an indefiniteness and haziness of
view which exaggerated his achievements into heroic
proportions. The Theseum was a notable instance of
such a monument. Here, it was believed, were deposited
the bones of Theseus after they had been brought back
to Athens, and here was a general asylum for criminals<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
who fled from the penalty of their misdeeds. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
these tombs was erected over the remains of Lycus<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>;
and a certain Germanicus, a <i>didaskalos</i> or school master,
apparently obtained so great a reputation that a
<i>heroum</i> was built in his honor<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.</p>

<p>A whole family was often buried in the same <i>heroum</i>.
There is reported an instance of a man’s buying one of
these temple-tombs for himself, his wife and child<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>; and,
in the third century, a rich woman, probably of Thera,
left by her will three thousand drachmas, almost six
hundred dollars for the erection of a <i>heroum</i> (which she
terms a <i>museum</i>), in honor of herself, her husband and
her two sons. She directed that sacrifices shall be offered
to them as heroes for three days in each year<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. In the
early period, when Athens was under Cecrops, the burials
were simple and inexpensive, but, shortly after
Solon’s time, it became so common to spend vast sums
on the tombs that a law was passed to check the outlay.
Cicero says that the elaborateness of the grave
was limited to what ten men could accomplish in
three days<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>; but Plato, in prescribing the limit which
should be observed, states, as has been before mentioned,
that it should only be as high as five men could
build in five days<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. Plato would add the further restriction
that no stone monument should be built larger
than to receive four hexameters in praise of the deceased<a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.
From many indications in literature, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
there is reason to believe that Plato’s suggestion was
not adopted. Diogiton, who was doing his best to defraud
his wards of their money by spending as little as
possible for their needs, purchased a memorial for their
father at twenty-four <i>minae</i> (about five hundred dollars).
This seems to have been considered a niggardly
sum for the purpose<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. On the other hand, the tomb
which Phormio erected in honor of his wife cost him
over two talents, which is over two thousand five hundred
dollars<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. In memory of Isocrates, there was erected
a monument forty-five feet high, on which was a siren
ten feet and a half in height, emblematic of his eloquence<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>It was such expenditures as these that led Demetrius
Phalereus, about the beginning of the fourth century
before Christ, to make another attempt to check funeral
extravagance. He tried to set a limit to the new tombs
by forbidding any tomb but the <i>kion</i> to be more than
four and a half feet high and by putting a special
officer in charge of the matter, but all his efforts proved
vain<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<p>The inscription that was carved on the tomb contained,
as is still the custom, the name and a few notices
about the life of the departed. In addition to those
details, the Greeks, at a later period, sometimes set
forth a curse on any one who should presume to desecrate
the grave in any way. Although this peculiar
protection of the last resting-place is not at present resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to among us, yet it is but a few centuries since
the custom was not uncommon in England. It will be
instructive to compare one of the older imprecations of
the Hellenes with the famous inscription on the tomb
of Shakespeare, composed possibly by the bard himself.
The Englishman wrote:</p>

<div class="pcont">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Good friend, for Jesus’ sake forbeare,</div>
<div class="verse">To digg the dust enclosed heare;</div>
<div class="verse">Bless be he yt spares these stones,</div>
<div class="verse">And curst be he yt moves my bones.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is somewhat more concise, if not quite as pointed
as some Greek inscriptions, one of which reads as
follows:</p>

<p>“I summon to the guardianship of this tomb the
lower gods, Pluto, Demeter, Persephone and all the
others. If any one despoils it, opens it, or in any way
disturbs it, by himself or an agent, may his journey on
land be obstructed, on the sea, may he be tempest-tossed
and thoroughly baffled and driven about in every
way. May he suffer every ill, chills and fevers, remittent
and intermittent, and the most repulsive skin diseases.
Whatever is injurious and destructive in life
may it fall on him that dares remove anything from
this tomb<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the Grecian tombs, like
that of the English poet, contain also all manner of
blessings and wishes for the absence of evil for him
and his posterity who may guard the tomb and perform
the sacrifices and other customary rites<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>To make sure that no one disturbed the bones, directions
were sometimes left in wills that the grave of the
testator be watched by slaves<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>These inscriptions, if they contained imprecations so
elaborate as that presented above, must have been
rather extended. In some states of Greece, the inscription
was very short. The Sicyonians, on the columns
which they raised to the dead, usually placed the
name of the departed, without stating his ancestry, but
exhorting the passer-by to wish well to his remains<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.
Lycurgus would not permit the Spartans to inscribe
the name of the deceased on the tomb, unless he had
fallen in battle; or if the deceased were a woman, unless
she had died in some sacred office<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>At Athens, there are found monuments inscribed to
deceased children and it would seem that this honor
was bestowed without reference to the age of the dead.
A tomb has been discovered with an inscription to a
child of seven that was lost on a mountain<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. Two
other epitaphs are dedicated to children who were but
two years old ere “disease had stopped their life<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.”</p>

<p>If we still possessed the book of Diodorus, or according
to some, Heliodorus, entitled “About Monuments,”
it would undoubtedly prove a mine of information.
Plutarch has referred to him, to determine the places
of sepulture both of Themistocles<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and Hyperides<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In the tomb, with the dead body, were placed various
vessels and trinkets. In the coffin found at Same, were
two small <i>lacrimatories</i> of unbaked clay; a wine beaker;
the <i>kylix</i>, a kind of libation vessel; the <i>prochoos</i>, a
pitcher usually having two handles and used for holding
pure wine or water; an alabaster box for jewels, called
the <i>kylichne</i>; and a bacchic mirror cover<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. The child’s
coffin, previously mentioned<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, disclosed eleven different
vessels and four clay images of <i>Gaea Olympia</i> in a
sitting posture. The vessels were three <i>lecyths</i>, two
large <i>cotyli</i>, one small <i>cotylus</i>, used for catching the
blood of the victim which was sacrificed, a lamp, a <i>diota</i>,
and a sort of child’s plaything<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these vessels, tombs have been found in
which all sorts of jewelry figured as parts of the contents,
such as golden finger rings set with garnets, gold
ear-rings wrought in fantastic shapes, and cornelian
ear-rings. Some of the tombs contain wreaths of laurel,
oak, olive, or myrtle, sometimes interwoven with
gold; while a brass buckle with an allegorical representation
of Cupid in the palestra, a golden girdle,
female statues, figures of Persephone and Hecate, a
statue of a priestess of Dodona with a dove on her
shoulder, and mirrors with brazen handles and backs
have all been found<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>This custom of interring valuables with the deceased
was very old. When the so-called grave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Alcmene was opened by Agesilaus, there were discovered
within, a small brazen armlet and two jars,
containing earth which had become petrified. This
grave must have been dug in very ancient times, for
tablets of brass were found within written in unintelligible
characters<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>This practice of burying various articles with the
dead must have continued during the best period
of art in Greece. That fact is attested by the workmanship
of the vases that have been exhumed. They
are many of them of the finest quality and artistic excellence.
The custom however, had died out before
the Christian era, for the colonists whom Caesar had
sent out to restore Corinth, in moving the ruins and
digging open the sepulchres, came across works of
pottery and brass, the workmanship of which was
greatly admired and the vessels sold readily at fabulous
prices as curiosities<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>

<p>There seems to have been no one place at Athens
selected for the situation of all the tombs except for
those who died in poverty. Those Athenians who left no
land or money behind them were entombed in a public
cemetery. This place was situated just outside the city<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
on one of the roads to the Peiraeus<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. The Itonic gate,
through which the bodies of these paupers were carried,
was, on this account, called the “gravegate<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>.” The
people of the richer classes, when they possessed a
bit of land, often directed that they should be interred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
therein; so it happened that there was no large assemblage
of graves at any one place. In one of Demosthenes’s
orations, the stone-cutter comes to the house
that he may complete the tomb in the neighboring
field<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. More frequently the graves were constructed
by the side of some much traveled road
where the passer-by might observe the monument.
From an inscription on a child’s tomb, we learn that
“her parents sorrowfully buried her at the junction of
three roads<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.” The square cut tombs of Isocrates and
his relations, which have been described, were situated
near the Cynosarges, the great exercising ground<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>,
while Thucydides was buried in the family burying
ground of Cimon<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>, near the Melitic gate<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

<p>The place of interment, as one might suppose, belonged
exclusively to the family, and strangers were
forbidden burial there by some well accepted law of
the Athenians<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>. This law, together with that making
it a crime to destroy a tomb, is attributed by Cicero to
Solon<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>. Accordingly, from the fact of a person being
buried in the tomb of a certain family, the orators
sometimes argued his relationship with that family,
for the purpose of establishing the connection of some
direct descendant. By that method, Demosthenes
sought to prove the descent of Eubulides from
Buselus<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>, and, in the same manner, demonstrated to
the court the citizenship of Euxitheus<a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In the earliest times, the reason for selecting the
former residence of the deceased as a place of burial
was that the departed might be near his family<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.
Later, however, in many of the states, there were enactments
passed which prohibited interments within
the city limits. At Delos, after 425 B. C., the Athenians
cleared the whole island of those already interred
there, and commanded that, thereafter, all corpses
should be carried to the adjoining small island of
Rhene<a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>. Among the Sicyonians, there was an ancient
law against burials within the city walls, and it had
been so religiously observed that even when the great
Aratus died, the people hesitated about entombing him
in the city until re-assured by a special dispensation
from the Delphic oracle<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. The Athenians were so particular
about preserving the very letter of a similar
law that even the cenotaphs of those who had been
slain in battle were erected in a beautiful suburb of
the city<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> on the way which led to the Academy<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>The motive of these states in requiring burial outside
the walls, was without doubt, to avoid the ceremonial
contamination supposed to arise from the proximity
of corpses.</p>

<p>Possibly, as was the case in ancient Rome, the effect
on the sanitary condition of the city made it desirable
to remove the burying ground<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. The very existence of
such laws indicates that the citizens must, at some time,
have experienced the ill effects of burials within the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>There were states, however, which, for various reasons,
preferred that the interments should be within the
walls. That was the case at Sparta, where we should
naturally expect to find laws directly the contrary.
Lycurgus even permitted the Spartans to raise tombs
near the temples. This he did that he might insure
the graves against the violence of the enemy<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>, and that,
at the same time, he might accustom the youths to the
sight from infancy, so that they might have no horror
of death<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. Again, the Tarentines, in compliance with
an oracle, buried all their dead within the walls in a
part of the city toward the east<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. The Megareans also
had within their city, the sepulchres of those who had
fallen in the war against the Medes, and likewise a heroic
monument called the Aesymnium. The origin of this
custom was as follows: Aesymnus, having been sent
to Delphi to ask the oracle what the Megareans should
do to be happy, returned with the response that this
might be if a number of them were “congregated
together.” This they interpreted to mean the burial
of their dead in one place, and accordingly, they instituted
a new cemetery in the city<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

THE FUNERAL FEAST.</h2>


<p>During the days of preparation for burial and that
on which the departed was entombed, his relatives
either overcome by sorrow or bound down by the
usages of the time, had been fasting. This abstinence
had the usual effect, and, by the time the remains of
the dear one had been laid under ground, his immediate
family were almost ready to faint with hunger.
That they might no longer thus afflict themselves and
that their friends might offer them suitable comfort,
the Greeks instituted the <i>perideipnon</i>, or funeral feast<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.
At this feast, the dead man was considered the host
and it was regarded as his expression of thanks to his
comrades for their courtesy in burying him<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. Since it
was the duty of the nearest surviving relative to provide
for all the customary obsequies<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>, properly this
entertainment was provided at his house<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. When the
question of a funeral feast in honor of Patroclus was
considered, Achilles, being his nearest friend then
present, prepares for it in his own tent. The <i>perideipnon</i>
for all those who had lost their lives in behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Greece at the disastrous battle of Chaeronea was held
at the house of the orator Demosthenes. That was
for the reason, as he himself states, that although each
was nearer to his own kin than the orator, yet no other
man was so near to them collectively<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

<p>The perideipnon was the beginning of a series of feasts
or ministrations having for their object the nourishment
of the dead in their new state of existence<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>. It was a
belief common to some other earlier nations as well as
the Greeks that those who had experienced the change
of death were still in need of food and drink and it was
conceived to be the duty of the living to satisfy
the desire for sustenance of that nature. The
ancient Hindus believed that, at the feasts, the <i>manes</i>
of their ancestors seated themselves at the table
near the living and enjoyed the viands set before them.
The Greeks seem to have entertained the same belief
and to have followed the same custom. Those rites long
outlasted the beliefs which gave rise to the observances.
The provision of material food for the dead was not
only regarded as a duty but was viewed as a means of
propitiating their good will.</p>

<p>If the funeral repasts were not continued at frequent
intervals, it was believed that the spirits became
malevolent and came out from the tombs, that the
wandering shades could be heard in the silent night,
reproaching the survivors with impious negligence and
that they sought to punish their recreant relatives
with sickness and unfruitfulness of the soil, until the
neglected office was resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the habit of the Greeks at these festivals, to
recount whatever virtues the deceased may have possessed,
but, quite contrary to the modern notion of the
obituary and the epitaph, no exaggeration or embellishment
was allowed, for it was reckoned impious to lie
on such occasions<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>. It was from this usage of presenting
the best view of the dead, that there arose the
sarcasm applied to bad characters, “you would not be
praised even at your funeral entertainment<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.” At this
supper, whatever fragments might chance to fall from
the table were always consecrated to the <i>manes</i> of the
departed<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>. Pythagoras, having in mind, perhaps, the
belief that all which fell to the floor belonged to the
dead, strictly forbade his disciples to pick up the particles
they may have dropped in any of their feastings<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="XI">XI.<br />
SACRIFICES AT THE GRAVE.</h2>


<p>The last step, or rather steps, in the obsequies, were
the succession of sacrifices which were performed in
honor of the deceased at his grave. No one but a relative
was allowed to offer these sacrifices since a person
visiting a strange tomb was suspected of a design to
steal the bones for superstitious purposes<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. This oblation
to the dead was discriminated among the Hellenes
from the ordinary sacrifices to the gods by a word
peculiarly appropriated. The word which indicated
this species of offering was <i>enagisma</i> and the idea implied
in it may best be rendered into English by the
word “purification<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.” The <i>enagisma</i> seems to have
been divided, according to its character, into two kinds
of sacrifice; namely, the <i>choe</i>, or “libation,” and the
<i>haimacouria</i> or “blood-propitiation.” The <i>choe</i> or
milder form, consisted merely of a libation of water,
milk or wine, together with an offering of olives, honey
and wreaths of flowers, “the offspring of all-producing
earth<a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.” At the <i>haimacouria</i>, on the other hand, before
the wine was poured, it was the custom to slay a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ram<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> or a black bull<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. This blood sacrifice, however,
was probably used only when they were sacrificing in
honor of a number of men. For instance, the warriors
who were slain in Boeotia, while defending Greece from
Mardonius, had that ceremony, on the anniversary
day of each year, performed at their graves by the
archon and the inhabitants of Plataea<a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. By the law of
Solon, heifers, as victims, were proscribed in these
solemnities<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>.</p>

<p>The offerings, however, were gradually made more
and more expensive until, on some occasions, a regular
feast was laid out and consumed by fire. In a Greek
dialogue that has come down to us, the old ferryman,
Charon, who had come to the upper world to view the
customs of men, expresses his surprise at these sepulchral
propitiations. “Why then,” says he, “do
they crown these stones and perfume them with unguents?
Why do they heap up funeral pyres before
the graves and burn these expensive feasts and pour
wine and a mixture of honey and water into this
trench<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>?”</p>

<p>The sacrifices at the sepulchre took place on stated
days. At the first of these ceremonies, called the <i>trita</i>,
from the fact of its falling on the third day<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> after the
interment, a lunch was brought out for the corpse<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.
Following that tertial offering, came another, the <i>ennata</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on the ninth day. This ninth day sacrifice, since
Aeschines speaks of it as if it were the only one to be
considered<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, and since Isaeus mentions the great expense
connected with it<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>, was very probably of more
importance than the others. It is uncertain of what it
consisted, since it is not specified in any of the Grecian
authorities; but, if any reliance can be placed on the
description of a Roman author, it was a regular banquet
prepared for the deceased<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. The <i>ennata</i> among the
Athenians, inasmuch as we find no mention of anything
farther in our ancient writers, probably concluded the
customary ceremonies. The Argives, varied these rites by
omitting the <i>trita</i> and <i>ennata</i>, and substituted a sacrifice
on the first and on the thirtieth day. It was their
custom upon losing one of their kindred or friends to
sacrifice immediately to Apollo and thirty days after to
Hermes<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. The Spartans, on the other hand, always
moderate in all their passions, limited their sacrifices
to one on the twelfth day to Ceres, after which they
ceased to mourn outwardly<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. But, with the Athenians,
the completion of the obsequies by no means ended all
the customary observances of a mourner. The thirtieth
day, however, seems to have been the limit set at Athens
for the public manifestation<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>. Any semblance of happiness
on the part of the mourner before that time was
strongly disapproved. Aeschines makes a serious accusation
against Demosthenes when he denounces him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for having offered sacrifices of thanksgiving for the
death of Philip when his daughter had been dead only
seven days<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>. Euphiletus, an every-day citizen of Athens,
has his suspicions of his wife’s infidelity intensified and
corroborated, because one day, before her brother had
been dead thirty days, he discovered her with her
cheeks painted<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the objects that were employed in the sacrifices
and services at the tomb, the basket that serves to carry
the offerings to the column is always in the hands of a
woman. It is always the same in appearance, long,
without a cover and shallow. This basket is often mentioned
in the descriptions of religious ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>,
where it is called <i>kanoun</i>, <i>kanes</i> and <i>kaniskion</i>. It appears
on the bas-reliefs as well as on the vases. The
young girls who carry the offerings at the Panathenaia
are called <i>canephorae</i><a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> from the name of this basket.</p>

<p>The casket, which the women hold in the paintings,
is usually a quadrangular box with a flat cover, and
sometimes has little projecting feet to support it. This
casket sometimes contains a precious offering, such as
a golden statuette or a lyre of ivory<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>The vases, of all the accessories of the funeral, are
the most varied in form and usefulness. The <i>hydria</i>
was used to mix the liquids for funeral libation, the
<i>oenochoe</i> and the <i>prochoos</i> contained the pure wine or
water, the <i>phiale</i> was a kind of shallow plate employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for making the libation, the <i>phlemochoe</i> was a vase having
the form of a top (a rim placed inside this vase retained
the solid part of the contents and permitted only
the purest part of the liquid to be poured out), the
<i>alabastron</i> and the <i>aryballa</i> held the oil which was
poured on the stone column for anointing it and perfuming
it, as if it were the dead person himself<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.</p>

<p>The repast prepared for the dead was presented in
two forms: (a) fruits or cakes placed in a basket, (b)
a libation poured out on the steps of the pillar. It is
difficult to determine the nature of these fruits or this
food. Our only knowledge is obtained, for the most
part, from the paintings on the vases and the resemblance
of an egg to a pomegranate is so close that the
object in the picture may be mistaken for either. The
delineation of the cake is not altogether clear, although
without doubt the honey-cake, the <i>melittouta</i>, is intended.
This cake is mentioned by Aristophanes<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>, and was
composed of meal and honey. For the libation, they
used water or pure wine or milk, and sometimes a
liquid made from honey<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. The pictures that have been
mentioned have no representation of the libations of
blood nor holocausts of victims that occur in the
authors.</p>

<p>With rare exceptions, the basket containing the offering
is borne by women, and it is women who bind the
bands around the pillar and place the crowns on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
base. Their gestures are, in general, calmer and more
measured in the ceremonies at the grave than in the
<i>prothesis</i>. Some of them, however, are yet seen carrying
their hands to their heads, as if to tear out their
hair, but their usual attitude is tranquil. There is less
of the expression of grief than of religious respect and
melancholy resignation. Yet one of the gestures
appears to signify something more than vague regret
and reverence. In a certain number of the paintings,
the characters depicted extending their hands toward
the tomb, or raising them to their faces bring together
the thumb and forefinger, in a manner specially noticeable.
In the museum of Dresden, there is an ancient
monument representing the seizure of the tripod of
Delphi by Hercules; a priestess is attaching some bandalettes
to it; she raises her right hand, pressing together
the thumb and forefinger. The vases, also, offer
other examples of this gesture, which is plainly ritualistic.</p>

<p>M. Benndorf regards, also, as a ritualistic gesture, the
open hand extended toward the pillar, with the palm
turned downwards. He supports this opinion by a
citation from Euripides<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>, where the slave of Admetus
extends his hand after that manner. Another verse<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> of
the same poet, evidently alludes to this custom. All
these attitudes appear on the paintings of the white
lecyths, and confirm the opinion that they express religious
homage rendered by the living to the dead, and
were part of the funeral ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Another peculiar observance is seen where the
mourners extend their hands toward the tomb, with a
motion which seems to indicate that they talk to the
dead. These are the pictures of familiar conversation,
bearing the formula of adieu, <i>chaire</i>, or a little
dialogue between the deceased and a passer-by.</p>

<p>There appears, also, to have been a custom of making
music at the foot of the tomb, for the purpose of cheering
the deceased in his solitude. The instrument used
is the lyre. On one of the paintings, it is a young man,
probably the deceased, sitting, who holds the lyre
while the assistants appear to listen.</p>

<p>Such were the practices of the Greeks while the bereavement
was recent, but it was always the duty of the
survivors, as long as their lives might last, to tend their
ancestors’ graves. Socrates, to rebuke his son, who has
been angered with his mother, and to impress upon him
how necessary it is properly to respect one’s parents
in their lifetime, reminds him that it is the custom for
the state, in its examination of candidates for the archonship,
to inquire if they have kept in good condition
the graves of their ancestors<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</p>

<p>Leocrates, who, in violation of the law, had left
Athens during the critical period following the battle
of Chaeronea, is arraigned by Lycurgus for having
abandoned his native land, having neglected the religion
of his country, and having deserted the tombs of
his forefathers<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>. To the Athenian mind, Isocrates
made a most touching appeal, when he represented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Plataeans as being in such a decimated condition that
not enough of them were left to tend the graves of
those who had defended Greece against the Persians.
After this master-stroke, nothing was left for the
Athenians to do but to make war on the impious Thebans,
who had so mercilessly reduced their allies<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.
Finally, listen to the exhortation which Aeschylus, in
“The Persians,” attributes to the herald before the
battle of Salamis:</p>

<p>“Advance! O, sons of Greece! preserve the freedom
of your native land; keep from foeman’s grasp your
children, your wives, the temples of your ancestral
gods, and the sepulchres of your progenitors. Now
the struggle is for all<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.”</p>

<h2 id="XII">XII.<br />
FURTHER CEREMONIES.</h2>


<p>In addition to the appointed sacrifices, there were
apparently other celebrations held at stated times beside
the tomb. These seasons Plato euphemistically
called “days not to be mentioned,” and he did not,
think it right at that time to hear sorrows of any kind<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.
These latter celebrations seem to have consisted for
the most part of libations to the dead, and to have been
celebrated by a cessation from the ordinary duties<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.
One of these mourning holidays was that called
<i>genesia</i><a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. From its apparent derivation, it may be assumed
to have been the celebration of the birthday of
the deceased. This conjecture is strengthened by the
will of Epicurus, found in Diogenes Laertius<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>, in which
he directs his heirs to arrange offerings to the <i>manes</i> of
his father, mother, brothers and himself, and to celebrate
his birthday each year on the tenth of the month
<i>Gamelion</i>. Herodotus also mentions the fact that the
Greeks, like the Issedones, had annual sacrifices for
the dead. Whether he refers to the <i>genesia</i> or to another
yearly offering known as the <i>nekysia</i> or to both is
uncertain<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>This <i>nekysia</i> was a general holiday for all Athens and
was dedicated to all the dead. It consisted of the same
sort of sacrificing as that which took place on the anniversary
of the birthday<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. Besides these ceremonies, it
was customary, in the very early times, to institute funeral
games in honor of the deceased shortly after the
burial. On the death of Azan, according to the myth, son
of Arcas, the king from whom Arcadia received its name,
these games were first established in Greece. In his
case, probably, the only contest was horse-racing<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. But
in the Homeric times, although the chariot race was
the most important, there were also a boxing match,
wrestling, a foot race, an armed combat, competition
in weight-casting, a trial at archery and a contest of
javelin throwing<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. There were suitable prizes in each
event for every one of the contestants. If the games
which the Greek chieftains arranged in memory of
Achilles, when he died, were any more elaborate than
these, as Agamemnon maintains they were, they must
have occupied considerable time<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>.</p>

<p>These celebrations occasionally occurred in the historic
period. Plutarch tells us that, after Timoleon’s death,
the people of Syracuse determined to honor him with
funeral games forever, to be celebrated with performances
in music, horse-racing and wrestling<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>It was the duty of every good citizen to visit the
graves of his dead not only on the days established for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
special services, but to come there much oftener since
the Greeks believed that the deceased was always pleased
by the presence of his friends of the former life. On
the same principle the dead were supposed to be tormented
by the visits of those formerly inimical. The
claimant to the estate of Astyphilus is made by Isaeus
to declare that it was generally accepted that the presence
of his father would be pleasing to the deceased, and so
the parent was carried out to the grave although in
feeble health<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>. Further along in his speech the same
man asserts that the father of Astyphilus had strictly
forbidden the father of the defendant or any one connected
with him to come near his tomb<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. The same
belief causes Teucer to restrain Odysseus from touching
the grave of Ajax lest he offend the deceased hero<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.</p>

<p>It is proper now to consider the conduct and dress
during the period of mourning. As with us, the predominant
manifestation of sorrow was abstinence from
every pleasure<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>. Admetus weepingly declares to his
wife that, when she is gone, he will put an end to all the
feasts and meetings in his house, at which they had
been wont mutually to enjoy wine, garlands, and song<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.</p>

<p>The other tokens of bereavement were the cutting of
the hair and the wearing of black garments. These customs
seem to have been practiced at a very early period
and to have lasted well down through Grecian history.
The tragic poets bear witness to their prevalence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Orestes shears his hair, and his sister is dressed in
black<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>; Helen mourns her husband with both these
signs of grief<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>; the chorus consider the advisibility of
employing the badges of sorrow while Alcestis is still
hovering between life and death<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>; and Iphigenia begs
her mother not to mourn her by severing her locks
and donning robes of sable hue<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. Even for a long
time after Grecian independence had been lost, the
same customs existed. Plutarch praised his wife for
not defiling herself or her maids nor putting on a black
garment<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. Artemidorus, in his work on the interpretation
of dreams, says that a black dress is used for
mourning<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>. Athenaeus is authority for the fact that in
his time the mourner still polled his head<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. Plutarch
seems to differ about this clipping of the hair. He
says: “In the case of mourning among the Greeks, the
women have their hair cut close, but the men wear it
long since it is customary for the men when not afflicted
by grief to have it cut short and for the woman
to let it grow long<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.” In another place he declares that
you may take away a man’s signs of mourning <em>by cutting
his hair</em> and drying his tears, and still bring him no
comfort<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. Undoubtedly, in Plutarch’s time, the fashion
had changed and the later Greeks were wont to let
their hair grow long to indicate their sorrow.</p>

<p>The underlying thought in this matter of mourning
was that one manifested his sympathy with the dead
by making himself appear as hideous as possible<a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the early times, when the Greeks wore beards and long
hair, the desired effect might be gained by polling
but, when the Roman fashion of close-cutting had been
adopted, it must have looked as odd to see the hair
streaming down the neck of a bereaved man, as one of
the enormous ruffs worn by Raleigh would appear in
New York to-day. Whatever may have been the custom
in the Romanized era of Plutarch, it is very certain
that black robes and shorn hair betokened bereavement
during the largest portion of the history of Greece.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, in imitation of the Persians, that the
Greeks, on the death of a general, clipped even the
manes and tails of their horses. When, on the expedition
of Mardonius, his trusted commander, Masistius,
was slain, the Persians mutilated their horses after
that fashion<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. At the death of the gluttonous young
Hephaestion, in consequence of disobedience to his
physician’s orders, Alexander, thoroughly orientalized,
ordered all the mules and horses to be clipped<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>. Not
satisfied with this, he must needs tear down
all the battlements of the neighboring cities, so that
they, too, might have the appearance of being shorn<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.
Aelian, very suitably, terms this latter extravagance,
“grieving according to the custom of the barbarians<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.”</p>

<p>The other distinguishing feature of the mourning,
the adoption of black robes, although it usually indicates
actual bereavement, was sometimes employed before
the loss had really come, but when it was impending.
Thus, when the sister-in-law of Lysias was summoned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the prison where her husband awaited death, she came
clad, as was befitting, in a black garment<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. It was this
fashion at Athens, of wearing black to show the death
of a relative that gave point to Pericles’s dying assertion:
“None of my fellow citizens have, through me,
been obliged to assume a sable garb<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.”</p>

<p>White was worn sometimes on the death of a great
general or other high official. Timoleon was borne to
the grave accompanied by a procession of Syracusans,
crowned with garlands and clothed in white. Pure
white<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> is also the color which Plato directs to be worn
on the death of a priest<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>.</p>

<p>It may not have been the rule in all the states of
Greece, as it was at Athens, to make black the mourning
color. Sparta, perhaps out of a feeling of antagonism
to Athens, appears to have employed white
mourning, referred to by Socrates as “robes rinsed in
water<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.”</p>

<p>It was the custom among the Greeks, when a good
character like Alcestis, had departed, to pray that the
earth might rest lightly upon the mortal frame<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>, but
where a man had done nothing except evil, they
wished that mother earth, like a huge night-mare, might
pin him down<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. The ancient Greeks have departed,
and, except when the prying hand of the archaeologist
has torn away their surroundings, they have lain undisturbed
for many centuries in the bosom of the
earth. Let it be <em>our</em> wish that she still continue to
rest lightly on good and bad alike.</p>
